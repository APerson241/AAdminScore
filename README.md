# AAdminScore
A tool for calculating a Wikipedia user's admin score.

Calculations (i.e. how many points should an edit count of x give you, and so on) are based off those from Scottywong's admin score tool, from which I also took the initial idea and which metrics to use.

At the moment, you can see it [on my github.io page](http://aperson241.github.io/aadminscore/aadminscore.html), although I hope to have it on the gh-pages branch here soon.
